Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong fired engineers who failed to onboard quickly with AI tools like GitHub Copilot, despite the company acquiring enterprise licenses for all engineers. His decision followed concerns about the slow adoption of AI tools, which some had predicted would take months. Armstrong's mandate was clear: engineers were required to familiarize themselves with AI systems, and those without a valid excuse for not doing so faced termination. While some viewed Armstrong's actions as heavy-handed, they underscored the importance he places on AI integration in the company. Armstrong has since focused on promoting further training, acknowledging the complexities of integrating AI-generated code, a concern also echoed by Stripe's co-founder, John Collison.

Bluesky, a social networking startup, has chosen to block access to its service in Mississippi rather than comply with a new state law mandating age verification for all users. The measure, known as HB 1126, requires platforms to verify the age of every user and gain parental consent for minors, posing a significant compliance challenge for smaller companies like Bluesky. The U.S. Supreme Court recently upheld the law, leading Bluesky to express concerns about privacy risks and the broad scope that could hinder innovation and free speech. Bluesky emphasizes that by enforcing age verification on all users, as opposed to just content access, the law imposes disproportionate costs that are easier for big tech to handle but detrimental to emerging companies. This decision specifically affects Bluesky's app built on the AT Protocol, highlighting complexities for smaller tech firms compared to larger players in adapting to such regulations.

The U.S. government plans to acquire a 10% stake in Intel, as confirmed by President Donald Trump, following Bloomberg's initial report. This announcement has led to a more than 7% increase in Intel's stock value. The proposal was made during a critical time for Intel, as its CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is currently undertaking a significant restructuring of the company. The U.S. government has rarely taken equity stakes in private firms, with notable exceptions during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. The Intel deal follows a recent $2 billion investment from Japan's SoftBank, underscoring a focus on advancing U.S. semiconductor technology.

Despite recent reports fueled by temporary website access, TikTok remains banned in India, as confirmed by TechCrunch. A spokesperson from the company and a senior Indian IT Ministry official stated that the ban imposed in 2020 under Section 69A of the IT Act is still in effect. The brief access, reported by Indian users claiming the site loaded without a VPN, was attributed to a network-level misconfiguration, similar to an incident in 2022. These developments highlight ongoing tensions and regulatory challenges for TikTok and other Chinese-linked apps in India.
